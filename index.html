            <h1>In the server room...</h1><br/>
            I was looking for something to do in the server room, something that would get me more involved in COSI.
            At this point in time, Phoenix bit the dust<!-- Began having bad crashing issues every 20 minutes basically and that's no good!-->,
            and I helped recover the files, and then spent many hours with Graham Northup 
            trying to repair the hardware into a state that would operate. Eventually, we found this state<!-- with half the processing power-->,
            and were able to get it back up and running<!-- on bennu mostly at the time -->. We called it Felix after this, since it means "lucky" and "successful" in Roman.
            <!-- To Alan's displeasure, we reinstalled the OS. We all make mistakes. Sorry, Alan. --><br/><br/>
            During the Jakening<!-- thanks Graham for this good name for this event --> and other events, I helped assure that essential services were up on both Bennu, and Felix.<br/><br/>
            During the Unjakening, I helped assure that essential services were up and also repaired network configurations on many servers.<br/><br/>
            On a regular basis, I try to streamline the VM states, by making efficiency changes to configurations without
            affecting the operational status of the VM's. By doing this, we were able to reduce the amount of RAM usage on Bennu
            from 2/3 of the ram used down to 1/3 of the ram used, without negatively affecting any VM's.
            I also contacted some VM maintainers and asked if they could also remove unnecessary services from their VM's and that helped as well.
            Additionally, I have been re-sparsify some of the VM images that have either grown large and then shrunk back,
            or VM's that were accidentally copied in the wrong way and became desparsified.<!--ç'est ma faute! (ops)--><br/><br/>
            I also recommended getting a physical thermometer for the server room. It allows us to <!--quickly and accurately!-->monitor the state of the server room.<br/><br/>
            I maintain the battery backups, checking them for error codes and also load balancing the hardware, which helps lengthen the lives of the battery backups.<br/><br/>
            I also have been helping set up new mirror.<!-- and being a man in the middle on IRC-->
            <!-- Phew! that's it... oh wait, there's more? dang!-->

            <h1>In COSI...</h1><br/>
            I am in COSI very often<!-- too often! -->, almost every day. I attend all of the meetings I can, and have only missed a small handful due to obligations,
            however whenever I am not obliged to be somewhere I am at the meetings.<br/><br/><!-- td;dr I am always at the meetings and forums -->
            I try to help people whenever I can. I helped a few CS141 students at the beginning of the semester with understanding g++ errors,
            and have also helped other people with installing different linux distros to their laptops. Some people I do not have enough experience to help,
            and I always try to direct them to the person in the labs that I think can best help to find a solution, and I make sure that they got what they
            came for <span style="font-style: italic">après sa</span>.<!--Urge to use some french complete..--><br/><br/>
            I also helped with events, such as Science Olympiad. I attended the event in COSI, cleaned the room,
            and then helped grade the projects at the end, providing important feedback.<br/><br/>
            I came up with the idea to put COSI tags on COSI flash drives so that we would not loose any
            flash drives as has happened in the past. This way, people don't mistake our flash drives with their own.<br/><br/><!-- Apparently all flash drives look alike-->
            I also make sure that the room is generally clean, and try to tidy whenever I can, especially on Sunday nights and when we have events upcoming.
            I have noted on multiple occasions that people notice how clean the room is when people walk in, and they tend to praise how clean it is when it is cleaned.

            <h1>Open Source Projects</h1>
            <h2><a href="http://management.cosi.clarkson.edu">management</a></h2>
            This project I started at the beginning of the semester. I was told that it was not a necessary project<!-- thanks for not being encouraging, Alan -->, but after making some good progress and
            creating a live page with stats, we have considered it to be helpful. Since it is still in active development, it is not always up,
            and there are some minor bugs that I am working on. In the end though, this will be a great project and will be important in lab maintainence.<br/><br/>

            <h3>New Mirror</h3>
            I created a git issue for some small thing on the new website. <!--Might have been a typo in a web page--> Might as well mention it.
